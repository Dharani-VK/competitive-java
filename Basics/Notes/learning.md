ðŸ“˜ My Java Competitive Programming Notes

âœ… Largest of 3 Numbers â€“ `LargestOfThree.java`
- Practiced using `Scanner` for input
- Applied `if-else if` conditionals and logical operators (`&&`)
- Understood comparison logic for three numbers

---

âœ… Prime Number Check â€“ `PrimeCheck.java`
- Implemented a highly optimized prime-checking logic using 6k Â± 1 rule
- Applied early returns to simplify conditions
- Handled edge cases such as 1, 2, and 3 specifically
- Learned to use methods like `isPrime()` for modular code

---

âœ… Prime Factors â€“ `PrimeFactors.java`
- Practiced finding and printing prime factors of a number
- Used `while` loops for repetitive factor division
- Skipped even numbers by starting loop from 3 and increasing by 2
- Understood prime factorization and efficient iteration up to âˆšn

---

âœ… Prime up to N â€“ `PrimeUptoN.java`
- Learned and implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Declared and used a boolean array to mark primes
- Used nested loops effectively to mark non-prime numbers
- Understood time complexity `O(n log log n)` and space trade-offs
